<h2>Guide for the teacher</h2>
<p>Once the course has been created indicating a number n of topics, a quiz composed of n questions is automatically created, linked to the course topics by scoring.</p>
<p>Each question adjusts the student&#39;s visualization of the related topic.</p>
<p><b>Warning: </b>If the self-evaluation quiz is removed, recreate the course from the beginning.</p><br>

<a name="conf"><h3>Initial configuration</h3></a>
<p>Once the course has been created, the teacher can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the topics created, changing the name and adding content and activities.</li>
<li>Customize the quiz questions, taking care <strong><u>not to change</u></strong> the scores.</li>
<a name="points"><p><b>Note: </b>If necessary, manually reassign the scores follow the rules:</p></a>
<ul>
<li>Question related to the topic 1  &#x2794  2<sup>0</sup> pts</li>
<li>Question related to the topic 2  &#x2794  2<sup>1</sup> pts</li>
<li>Question related to the topic 3  &#x2794  2<sup>2</sup> pts</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul></ul>
<hr><p><br></p>
<a name="addt"><h3>Addition of topics to the course</h3></a>
<h4><li>If the course has not yet been presented to the students or none of the students has yet attempted the quiz</li></h4>
<p>The addition of a topic involves the automatic insertion of a question connected to it through the score.</p>
<p>It is therefore necessary to customize the new question created</p>
<h4><li>If the course has been presented to the students and there are attempts at the quiz</li></h4>
<p>The new topic is not linked to the quiz and is visible to all students.</p>
<hr><p><br></p>
<a name="delt"><h3>Removal of topics from the course</h3></a>
<h4><li>If the course has not yet been presented to the students or none of the students has yet attempted the quiz</li></h4>
<p>Removing a topic involves deleting a question from the quiz.</p>
<p>Following the removal of the argument it is advised to check the maintenance of the question-topic link for all the questions.</p>
<h4><li>If the course has been presented to the students and there are attempts at the quiz</li></h4>
<p>Only topics not related to the quiz can be removed</p>
<p><b>Attention!</b><br>Do not remove topics related to the quiz: the topic is deleted but the quiz question is not deleted.</p>
<hr><p><br></p>
<a name="modq"><h3>Addition / removal of questions to the quiz</h3></a>
<p>The course format is topics-depending so the behavior is as follows:</p>
<h4><li>Addition</li></h4>
<p>The question once saved will be automatically removed</p>
<h4><li>Removal</li></h4>
<p>The question is removed, but a new default question will automatically be generated</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If there are already attempts at the Moodle quiz, it does not allow modification to any question.</p></a>
